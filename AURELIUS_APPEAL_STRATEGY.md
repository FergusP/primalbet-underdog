## **ðŸŽ­ The Psychology of Aurelius**

The key is making every single game feel like it COULD be "the one" where you win big, while keeping the mechanics simple enough that anyone thinks they have a chance.

**Core Loop Psychology**:
1. **Entry**: "This time I'll win" (Hope)
2. **Early Game**: "I'm doing well!" (Confidence)
3. **Mid Game**: "Just need to survive" (Tension)
4. **Late Game**: "SO CLOSE!" (Excitement)
5. **Result**: Win = Euphoria, Lose = "One more try"

This creates an endless cycle where:
- **Wins** feel earned and skillful
- **Losses** feel unlucky or "almost won"
- **Every game** feels winnable
- **Entry fee** feels insignificant vs potential
