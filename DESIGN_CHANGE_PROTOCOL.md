## **üîÑ Step-by-Step Change Process**

### **Step 1: Identify Change Category**
Determine which category your change falls into using the guide above.

### **Step 2: Create Design Branch**
```bash
# Format: design/category-description
git checkout -b design/combat-damage-increase
git checkout -b design/new-powerup-freeze
git checkout -b design/ui-arena-resize
```

### **Step 3: Update Documents in Order**

**Order of Updates:**
1. **AURELIUS_GAME_DESIGN.md** - Update the vision first
2. **INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md** - Update technical specs (if needed)
3. **PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md** - Add new tasks (if needed)
4. **DESIGN_CHANGE_LOG.md** - Log the change (create if doesn't exist)

### **Step 4: Validate Changes**

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All affected sections updated?
- [ ] Constants match between documents?
- [ ] Interface contract still valid?
- [ ] No breaking changes without version bump?
- [ ] Partner tasks clearly defined?

### **Step 5: Commit with Structured Message**

```bash
git commit -m "design: [CATEGORY] Brief description

Changes:
- What changed and why
- Old value ‚Üí New value

Docs updated:
- GAME_DESIGN.md: sections X, Y
- INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md: constants Z

Affects:
- Partner A: combat calculations
- Partner B: damage display"
```

### **Step 6: Notify Partner**

Use this template:
```markdown
üéÆ DESIGN CHANGE: [Category] - Title

**Summary:** Brief description of change

**Details:**
- Specific change 1: old ‚Üí new
- Specific change 2: old ‚Üí new

**Documents Updated:**
- [Link to GAME_DESIGN.md changes]
- [Link to INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md changes]

**Your Action Required:**
- Partner A: Update X in server code
- Partner B: Update Y in UI code

**Reason:** Why this change improves the game

**Branch:** `design/your-branch-name`
```

## **üìä Quick Decision Matrix**

| Question | Yes ‚Üí | No ‚Üí |
|----------|-------|------|
| Does it change how systems communicate? | Update INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md | Skip INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md |
| Does it affect game balance? | Update GAME_DESIGN.md Section 6 | Check if visual only |
| Does it change on-chain logic? | CRITICAL: Discuss with Partner A first | Proceed with updates |
| Does it add new features? | Update all 3 docs + discuss | Just update GAME_DESIGN.md |
| Does it only change visuals? | Update GAME_DESIGN.md only | Re-evaluate the change |

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules**

### **RULE 1: Interface Contract is Sacred**
- ANY change to INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md requires both partners' approval
- Breaking changes require version increment
- Test with mocks before implementing

### **RULE 2: Communication is Key**
- Notify BEFORE implementing if it affects partner's code
- Notify AFTER implementing if it's information only
- When in doubt, over-communicate

### **RULE 3: Document Everything**
- Every change needs a commit message
- Major changes need a design doc
- Keep a DESIGN_CHANGE_LOG.md for history

## **ü§ñ AI Assistant Instructions**

When I mention a game design change:

1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - What specific values/mechanics are changing?
   - Why is this change being made?
   - Have you discussed with your partner?

2. **Identify the category** from this document

3. **List all documents** that need updating based on the category

4. **Provide the exact sections** to update in each document

5. **Generate the notification message** for the partner

6. **Suggest any potential impacts** not mentioned

7. **Remind about critical rules** if applicable

## **üìù Change Log Template**

Create a `DESIGN_CHANGE_LOG.md` to track all changes:

```markdown
# Design Change Log

## [Date] - Category: Change Title
- **Changed:** What was modified
- **Reason:** Why it was changed  
- **Docs Updated:** List of documents
- **Partner Impact:** What each partner needs to do
- **Commit:** Link to commit
```

---

## **üöÄ Quick Reference Commands**

```bash
# When starting a design change
./scripts/design-change.sh [category] [description]

# Check what docs need updating
grep -r "old_value" *.md

# Validate interface contract
npm run validate:interface

# Notify partner (if using Discord webhook)
./scripts/notify-partner.sh "Change description"
```
