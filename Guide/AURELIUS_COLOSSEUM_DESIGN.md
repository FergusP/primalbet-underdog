# **🏛️ AURELIUS COLOSSEUM: GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT**
*Monster-Fighting Jackpot Arena on Solana*

## **🎯 Core Concept**

**Aurelius Colosseum** is a skill-based jackpot game where players send gladiators to fight progressively harder monsters. Each victory gives a chance to crack the treasure vault and claim the growing SOL prize pool. Failed attempts add to the jackpot, creating escalating stakes and FOMO.

**One-Line Pitch:** *"Fight monsters, crack the vault, or die trying - every death grows the treasure!"*

## **🔥 Core Game Loop**

```
PAY 0.01 SOL → ENTER ARENA → SKILL-BASED COMBAT → WIN/LOSE → VRF VAULT CRACK
      ↑                                                              ↓
      ←←←←←←← FOMO KICKS IN (Bigger Pot, Harder Monster) ←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **💰 Pay to Enter** 
   - Fixed entry fee: 0.01 SOL per attempt
   - 100% goes to prize pool (platform fee from jackpot wins)
   - Payment validates combat session

2. **⚔️ Real-Time Combat**
   - Monster type based on current prize pool size
   - **Player-controlled combat** with movement and attacks
   - Skill determines victory (dodging, timing, positioning)

3. **🎮 Combat Resolution**
   - **Victory:** Proceed to vault crack attempt
   - **Defeat:** Entry fee grows the prize pool
   - Frontend determines outcome, backend validates

4. **🏆 Vault Crack Attempt** (if victorious)
   - **VRF-based** roll for jackpot chance
   - Success = claim entire prize pool!
   - Failure = survive but no prize (pool remains)

5. **🔄 New Round**
   - Bigger pool = stronger monster spawns
   - Higher stakes, better crack odds
   - FOMO intensifies!

## **👹 Monster Progression System**

Monsters scale with the prize pool, creating natural difficulty progression:

```typescript
// Example progression (you can adjust these)
interface MonsterTier {
  name: string;
  poolRange: [number, number]; // SOL amounts
  baseHealth: number;
  vaultCrackChance: number;   // % chance if defeated
  entryFee: number;            // SOL required
}

// Fixed 0.01 SOL entry for all tiers
const MONSTER_TIERS = [
  { name: "Skeleton",    poolRange: [0, 0.3],    baseHealth: 80,   vaultCrackChance: 0.5,  perEntryBonus: 0.05 },
  { name: "Goblin",      poolRange: [0.3, 0.8],  baseHealth: 100,  vaultCrackChance: 1,    perEntryBonus: 0.08 },
  { name: "Shadow",      poolRange: [0.8, 1.5],  baseHealth: 130,  vaultCrackChance: 2,    perEntryBonus: 0.1 },
  { name: "Demon",       poolRange: [1.5, 2.3],  baseHealth: 170,  vaultCrackChance: 3.5,  perEntryBonus: 0.15 },
  { name: "Dragon",      poolRange: [2.3, 3.0],  baseHealth: 220,  vaultCrackChance: 6,    perEntryBonus: 0.2 },
  { name: "Titan",       poolRange: [3.0, Inf],  baseHealth: 280,  vaultCrackChance: 10,   perEntryBonus: 0.25 }
];
```

## **⚔️ Combat Mechanics**

### **Real-Time Skill-Based Combat**
```typescript
interface CombatMechanics {
  // Player controls
  movement: 'WASD' | 'Arrow Keys';
  attack: 'Space' | 'Left Click';
  dodge: 'Movement timing';
  
  // Combat features
  playerHealth: 100;
  monsterHealth: baseHealth; // Varies by tier
  meleeDamage: 15-40;        // Per hit
  attackCooldown: 500ms;     // Between attacks
  
  // Victory conditions
  victory: monsterHealth <= 0;
  defeat: playerHealth <= 0;
}
```

### **Backend Validation**
```typescript
interface CombatValidation {
  minimumDuration: 3000;      // 3 seconds
  damageDealt: monsterHP ± 20%; // Tolerance
  sessionBased: true;         // Prevent replay
}

## **💎 Vault Crack Mechanics**

After defeating a monster, gladiators attempt to crack the vault:

```typescript
interface VaultCrackAttempt {
  monsterDefeated: MonsterType;
  baseCrackChance: number; // From monster tier
  
  // Roll for vault crack
  vrfRoll: number = ProofNetworkVRF(1, 100);
  success: boolean = vrfRoll <= baseCrackChance;
  
  // If successful
  prizeAmount: number = currentPrizePool;
  newRound: boolean = true; // Reset to skeleton
}
```

## **🎮 Game Features**

### **Live Arena View**
- See current monster and its health
- Watch other gladiators fight (async multiplayer feel)
- Live prize pool counter
- Recent combat log: "Marcus slain by Hydra!"

### **Gladiator Leaderboard**
```typescript
interface GladiatorRecord {
  wallet: PublicKey;
  monstersSlain: number;
  vaultsCracked: number;
  totalWinnings: number;
  currentStreak: number;
  favoriteMonster: string; // Most defeated
}
```

### **Progressive Difficulty**
- Early players: Easy monsters, small pools, low crack chance
- Late players: Epic monsters, huge pools, high crack chance
- Sweet spot: Mid-tier monsters with decent risk/reward

### **Anti-Whale Mechanics**
- Entry amount provides linear power (no exponential advantage)
- Tough monsters require skill/luck, not just big entries
- Maximum entry caps per monster tier

## **🏛️ Thematic Elements**

### **Colosseum Atmosphere**
- Epic orchestral combat music
- Crowd cheers on victories
- Monster roars and death sounds
- Announcer voice: "A new challenger approaches!"

### **Visual Design**
- Top-down colosseum arena view
- Gladiator vs Monster in center
- Treasure vault glowing in background
- Blood splatter effects (optional)
- Particle effects for combat

### **Narrative Hooks**
- "The Vault of Sol has stood unopened for centuries..."
- "Only the bravest gladiators dare face the guardian beasts"
- "Every fallen warrior's gold makes the next beast stronger"

## **💰 Economic Model**

### **Prize Pool Distribution**
```typescript
interface FeeStructure {
  entryFee: 0.01 SOL;         // Fixed for all tiers
  toPrizePool: 100%;          // All goes to jackpot
  platformFee: 10%;           // Taken from jackpot wins only
}

interface PrizeDistribution {
  vaultCracker: 90%;          // Winner gets 90%
  platform: 10%;              // Platform sustainability
  newPot: 0;                  // Reset to zero
}
```

### **Economic Balance**
