# **🏛️ AURELIUS COLOSSEUM: GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT**
*Monster-Fighting Jackpot Arena on Solana*

## **🎯 Core Concept**

**Aurelius Colosseum** is a skill-based jackpot game where players send gladiators to fight progressively harder monsters. Each victory gives a chance to crack the treasure vault and claim the growing SOL prize pool. Failed attempts add to the jackpot, creating escalating stakes and FOMO.

**One-Line Pitch:** *"Fight monsters, crack the vault, or die trying - every death grows the treasure!"*

## **🔥 Core Game Loop**

```
PAY SOL → ENTER COLOSSEUM → FIGHT MONSTER → WIN/DIE → CRACK VAULT OR GROW POT
    ↑                                                              ↓
    ←←←←←←← FOMO KICKS IN (Bigger Pot, Harder Monster) ←←←←←←←←←←←
```

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **💰 Pay to Enter** 
   - Entry fee: 0.01-0.1 SOL (scales with current monster)
   - 90% goes to prize pool, 10% platform fee
   - Each entry spawns your gladiator

2. **⚔️ Fight Current Monster**
   - Monster type based on current prize pool size
   - Combat resolved via ProofNetwork VRF
   - Your gladiator power = entry amount × skill factor

3. **🎲 Combat Resolution**
   - **Victory:** Proceed to vault crack attempt
   - **Death:** Entry fee grows the prize pool
   - All combat is verifiably random (VRF)

4. **🏆 Vault Crack Attempt** (if victorious)
   - Roll for jackpot based on monster difficulty
   - Success = claim entire prize pool!
   - Failure = survive but no prize (pool remains)

5. **🔄 New Round**
   - Bigger pool = stronger monster spawns
   - Higher stakes, better crack odds
   - FOMO intensifies!

## **👹 Monster Progression System**

Monsters scale with the prize pool, creating natural difficulty progression:

```typescript
// Example progression (you can adjust these)
interface MonsterTier {
  name: string;
  poolRange: [number, number]; // SOL amounts
  baseHealth: number;
  vaultCrackChance: number;   // % chance if defeated
  entryFee: number;            // SOL required
}

const MONSTER_TIERS = [
  { name: "Skeleton",    poolRange: [0, 1],      baseHealth: 100,  vaultCrackChance: 10,  entryFee: 0.01 },
  { name: "Goblin",      poolRange: [1, 3],      baseHealth: 200,  vaultCrackChance: 20,  entryFee: 0.02 },
  { name: "Minotaur",    poolRange: [3, 10],     baseHealth: 400,  vaultCrackChance: 35,  entryFee: 0.05 },
  { name: "Hydra",       poolRange: [10, 25],    baseHealth: 800,  vaultCrackChance: 50,  entryFee: 0.1 },
  { name: "Dragon",      poolRange: [25, 100],   baseHealth: 1500, vaultCrackChance: 70,  entryFee: 0.25 },
  { name: "Titan",       poolRange: [100, Inf],  baseHealth: 3000, vaultCrackChance: 90,  entryFee: 0.5 }
];
```

## **⚔️ Combat Mechanics**

### **Simple RNG Combat (MVP)**
```typescript
interface CombatSimulation {
  // Gladiator stats
  gladiatorPower: number = entryAmount * 1000; // Base multiplier
  gladiatorRoll: number = ProofNetworkVRF(0, 100); // Random 0-100
  
  // Monster stats  
  monsterHealth: number = currentMonster.baseHealth;
  monsterRoll: number = ProofNetworkVRF(0, 100);
  
  // Combat resolution
  gladiatorAttack: number = gladiatorPower * (gladiatorRoll / 100);
  monsterDefense: number = monsterHealth * (monsterRoll / 100);
  
  result: 'VICTORY' | 'DEATH' = gladiatorAttack > monsterDefense ? 'VICTORY' : 'DEATH';
}
```

### **Interactive Combat (Future Enhancement)**
- Quick-time event: Time your attack for bonus damage
- Multiple attack rounds with health bars
- Special abilities based on entry amount
- Combo system for skilled players

## **💎 Vault Crack Mechanics**

After defeating a monster, gladiators attempt to crack the vault:

```typescript
interface VaultCrackAttempt {
  monsterDefeated: MonsterType;
  baseCrackChance: number; // From monster tier
  
  // Roll for vault crack
  vrfRoll: number = ProofNetworkVRF(1, 100);
  success: boolean = vrfRoll <= baseCrackChance;
  
  // If successful
  prizeAmount: number = currentPrizePool;
  newRound: boolean = true; // Reset to skeleton
}
```

## **🎮 Game Features**

### **Live Arena View**
- See current monster and its health
- Watch other gladiators fight (async multiplayer feel)
- Live prize pool counter
- Recent combat log: "Marcus slain by Hydra!"

### **Gladiator Leaderboard**
```typescript
interface GladiatorRecord {
  wallet: PublicKey;
  monstersSlain: number;
  vaultsCracked: number;
  totalWinnings: number;
  currentStreak: number;
  favoriteMonster: string; // Most defeated
}
```

### **Progressive Difficulty**
- Early players: Easy monsters, small pools, low crack chance
- Late players: Epic monsters, huge pools, high crack chance
- Sweet spot: Mid-tier monsters with decent risk/reward

### **Anti-Whale Mechanics**
- Entry amount provides linear power (no exponential advantage)
- Tough monsters require skill/luck, not just big entries
- Maximum entry caps per monster tier

## **🏛️ Thematic Elements**

### **Colosseum Atmosphere**

- Crowd cheers on victories
- Monster roars and death sounds
- Announcer voice: "A new challenger approaches!"

### **Visual Design**

### **Narrative Hooks**

- "Only the bravest gladiators dare face the guardian beasts"
- "Every fallen warrior's gold makes the next beast stronger"

## **💰 Economic Model**

### **Prize Pool Distribution**
```typescript
interface FeeStructure {
  entryFee: number;           // Varies by monster
  toPrizePool: number = 90%;  // Grows the jackpot
  toPlatform: number = 10%;   // Sustainability
}

interface PrizeDistribution {
  vaultCracker: number = 100%; // Winner takes all
  nextRound: number = 0%;      // Fresh start
}
```
