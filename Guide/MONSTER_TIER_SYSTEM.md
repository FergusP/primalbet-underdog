With a low entry barrier of 0.01 SOL (~$2.50), players engage in progressively challenging monster battles with increasing vault crack chances, creating a perfect balance of risk, skill, and reward.

**Key Appeal Points:**
- **Low Risk Entry**: Only 0.01 SOL per attempt

## Core Game Mechanics

### Entry System
- **Fixed Entry Fee**: 0.01 SOL per combat attempt (never changes)
- **Pool Growth**: Every entry adds 0.01 SOL to the jackpot
- **No Hidden Costs**: What you see is what you pay
- **Immediate Action**: Enter battle instantly upon payment

### Victory Requirement
**Critical Design Element**: Players MUST defeat the monster to access the vault. No monster victory = No vault attempt. This ensures:
- Skill component remains relevant at all tiers
- Players can't brute-force through impossible monsters
- Difficulty scaling must remain achievable

## Monster Tier Progression Table

| Tier | Monster | Pool Range | HP | HP Increase | Base Crack % | Per-Entry Bonus | Max Crack % | Target Win Rate |
|------|---------|------------|-----|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Skeleton Warrior | 0 - 0.3 SOL | 80 | - | 0.5% | +0.05% | 2% | 90% |
| 2 | Goblin Berserker | 0.3 - 0.8 SOL | 100 | +25% | 1% | +0.08% | 5% | 85% |
| 3 | Shadow Assassin | 0.8 - 1.5 SOL | 130 | +62% | 2% | +0.1% | 9% | 75% |
| 4 | Demon Knight | 1.5 - 2.3 SOL | 170 | +112% | 3.5% | +0.15% | 15% | 65% |

| 6 | Ancient Titan | 3.0+ SOL | 280 | +250% | 10% | +0.25% | 25% | 45% |

### Vault Crack Chance Calculation
```
Total Crack Chance = Base Crack Chance + (Entries Since Tier Started × Per-Entry Bonus)
```

**Example**: Dragon Lord with 35 entries since reaching Tier 5:
- Base: 6%
- Bonus: 35 × 0.2% = 7%
- **Total: 13% crack chance**

## Mathematical Analysis

### Expected Value Calculations

**Tier 1 Example (Worst Case):**
- Entry Cost: 0.01 SOL
- Average Pool: 0.15 SOL
- Max Crack Chance: 2%
- Expected Value: (0.15 × 0.02) - 0.01 = -0.007 SOL
- House Edge: 70%

**Tier 6 Example (Best Case):**
- Entry Cost: 0.01 SOL  
- Average Pool: 3.5 SOL
- Max Crack Chance: 25%
- Expected Value: (3.5 × 0.25) - 0.01 = +0.865 SOL
- Player Advantage: 8650%

**System Balance:**
- Early tiers favor house (sustainability)
- Late tiers favor skilled players (reward)
- Average across all tiers maintains house edge
- Skill component allows players to improve odds

### Pot Growth Dynamics

**Path to Maximum Tier:**
- Tier 1: 30 entries (0.3 SOL)
- Tier 2: 50 entries (0.5 SOL)  
- Tier 3: 70 entries (0.7 SOL)
- Tier 4: 80 entries (0.8 SOL)
- Tier 5: 70 entries (0.7 SOL)
- **Total: 300 entries to reach maximum rewards**

**Time Estimates:**
- 10 active players: ~30 minutes to max tier
- 25 active players: ~12 minutes to max tier  
- 50 active players: ~6 minutes to max tier
