# ðŸŽ® DESIGN CHANGE: [NEW FEATURES] - Dual-Mode System Implementation

**Summary:** Aurelius now features two distinct game modes - Arena Blitz (quick 90s battles) and Glory Siege (strategic 5min wars), along with comprehensive balance mechanics.

## **Details:**

### Major Changes:
1. **Dual Game Modes:**
   - Arena Blitz: 90-second quick battles, 0.002 SOL entry, single winner
   - Glory Siege: 5-minute strategic wars, 0.01 SOL entry, top 3 winners

2. **Balance Mechanics:**
   - Early entry bonuses: +1% damage per 10s survived, kill rewards
   - Late entry penalties: Start with 70 HP, random spawn, higher fees
   - Underdog mechanics: Damage/speed bonuses when outnumbered

3. **Special Features:**
   - Godslayer Orb: Ultra-rare 50 damage power-up
   - Second Wind Miracle: 2% chance to heal when near death
   - Chaos Equalizer Events: Random events that balance gameplay
   - Dynamic Modifiers: 0-2 per game (Blood Moon, Tiny Arena, etc.)

4. **Multi-Warrior System:**
   - Players can enter multiple warriors with scaling costs
   - Entry fees scale: 1st=base, 2nd=1.05x, 3rd=1.10x, etc.

## **Documents Updated:**
- [AURELIUS_GAME_DESIGN.md](./AURELIUS_GAME_DESIGN.md) - Sections 1, 2, 6, 10 completely revised
- [INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md](./INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) - Version 2.0.0 with all new data structures
- [PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md](./PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md) - Updated task counts and integration checkpoints
- [DUAL_MODE_COMPLETE_DESIGN.md](./DUAL_MODE_COMPLETE_DESIGN.md) - NEW: Complete dual-mode reference

## **Your Action Required:**

### Partner B Frontend Tasks:
1. **Update Menu System:**
   - Add mode selection screen (Blitz vs Siege)
   - Show different timers and player counts for each mode
   - Display mode-specific rules and prizes

2. **Modify Arena Scene:**
   - Support both instant start (Blitz) and prep phase (Siege)
   - Add zone indicators for Siege mode (outer/mid/center)
   - Implement territory control visuals

3. **Enhance Power-Up System:**
   - Add Godslayer Orb sprite and effects
   - Create enhanced power-up versions for Siege
   - Add combination/stacking logic

4. **Special Effects:**
   - Second Wind phoenix animation
   - Underdog "Lone Wolf" aura
   - Chaos event animations (lightning, teleport, etc.)
   - Dynamic modifier indicators

5. **Update HUD:**
   - Mode-specific phase displays
   - Active modifier badges
   - Multi-warrior tracking UI
   - Top 3 placement display for Siege

6. **WebSocket Updates:**
   - Handle new `gameMode` field in all events
   - Support `specialEvent` event type
   - Update warrior data with `veteranBonus` and `entryTime`

## **Reason:** 
The dual-mode system solves three critical problems:
1. **Variety Without Complexity**: Two modes with same core rules appeal to different players
2. **Fair Without Boring**: Late entry penalties and underdog mechanics balance gameplay
3. **Revenue Optimization**: 3-4x revenue potential with different price points

## **Branch:** `design/dual-mode-system`

## **Critical Constants Changed:**
```typescript
// Old
SHRINK_START_TIME: 90
POWERUP_SPAWN_RATE: 15-60s
BASE_ENTRY_FEE: 0.002 SOL

// New - Mode Specific
BLITZ.SHRINK_START_TIME: 45
SIEGE.SHRINK_PHASES: [120, 210, 270]
BLITZ.POWERUP_RATES: 10-30s
SIEGE.POWERUP_RATES: 20-60s
ENTRY_FEES: { BLITZ: 0.002, SIEGE: 0.01 }
```

## **Integration Notes:**
- All WebSocket events now include `gameMode` field
- Power-ups can have `tier: 'normal' | 'enhanced'`
- Warriors track `eliminations` and `veteranBonus`
- New `specialEvent` WebSocket event type
- GameEscrow supports multi-winner array
