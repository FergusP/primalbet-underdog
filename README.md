## üéØ How It Works (For Judges)

### Architecture Overview
1. **Frontend** handles real-time combat with player skill determining outcomes
2. **Backend** validates combat sessions (minimum 3s duration, damage within ¬±20% of monster HP)
3. **Blockchain** stores minimal data - just pot amount and processes payouts
4. **VRF** is used ONLY for vault crack attempts, not combat outcomes

### Why This Design?
- **Skill > Luck**: Combat is determined by player ability, not RNG
- **Anti-Cheat**: Simple validation prevents obvious exploits
- **Minimal On-chain**: Reduces costs and complexity
- **Growing Stakes**: Failed attempts create FOMO as jackpot increases

### Monster Progression
| Pot Size | Monster | HP | Vault Chance |
|----------|---------|-----|-------------|
| 0-0.01 SOL | Orc | 80 | Low |
| 0.01-0.02 SOL | Armored Orc | 100 | Medium |
| 0.02-0.03 SOL | Elite Orc | 130 | Low |
| 0.03-0.04 SOL | Orc Rider | 170 | Low |
| 0.04+ SOL | Werewolf | 100 | None (must evolve) |
| Evolution | Werebear | 100 | Very High |
